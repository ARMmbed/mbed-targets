# Azure Pipeline for Build and Release a Python package.
#
# This pipeline performs multiple actions to ensure the quality of the package:
# - Performs static analysis and runs test on multiple Python versions and host platforms.
# - Uploads test coverage to Code Climate
# - Generates reference documentation
# - Optionally releases the software on PyPI

# A build is triggered on every push to any branch so don't use PR triggers

    # normal dependencies from setup.py) and then installs via pip. As a virtual machine is already being used, pipenv
